  description: 'SubSupply Global exists to simplify global trade for importers who are tired of managing multiple exporters, agents, and service providers. We don\'t introduce buyers to sellers. We don\'t act as a loose intermediary. Importers deal only with SubSupply Global. Everything else happens inside our controlled, verified ecosystem.',

  whyWeWereBuilt: 'Most supply chains fail because responsibility is spread across too many hands. One exporter handles pricing. Another agent handles logistics. Someone else handles compliance. And when things go wrong, no one owns the outcome. SubSupply Global was built to fix that. We operate as a single, centralized supply partner, taking full responsibility from sourcing to shipment, quality to compliance — so importers can scale with confidence.',
  whatWeDo: [
    'Sourcing and procurement',
    'Product development and supplier alignment',
    'Supply chain and container execution',
    'Lab testing, compliance, and assessments',
    'On-ground coordination in India and Dubai',
  ],
  howModelIsDifferent: 'We do not facilitate trade between importers and exporters. There is no direct dealing with exporters, no unmanaged commission agents, and no fragmented workflows. Instead: Importers contract with SubSupply Global. Suppliers operate under our verification, processes, and standards. Trade and commission-based deals stay fully within our ecosystem. This allows us to deliver stable supply, better control, and predictable outcomes.',
  ecosystemDescription: 'SubSupply Global operates an organized and verified network that includes Franchise Owners — partners who operate under the SubSupply model, with structured commission billing, priority container allocation, and long-term supply alignment. And Verified Suppliers — approved producers who meet our sourcing, quality, and compliance requirements. Both operate under the same standards — ensuring consistency, reliability, and transparency for importers.',
  howWeWorkWithYou: 'We don\'t work for you. We work with you — as an extension of your team. On your behalf, we identify and manage the right suppliers, coordinate production and specifications, handle logistics, CHA, and freight partners, oversee quality checks and compliance, and resolve issues before they reach you. Many of our clients see us as their on-ground supply team — without the cost or complexity of building one.',
  whoWeServe: 'We work with importers who value stable, long-term supply chains, verified and compliant suppliers, transparent pricing and commission structures, and reliable execution across India and UAE.',
  vision: 'To create a trusted, organized supply ecosystem where global trade feels simple, predictable, and dependable.',
